                          I felt the Call in the ministry at a young age
                          of twenty five working with youth, teaching,
                          and my new wife and I conducting childrenâ€™s church,
                          and  attending Bible School. We worked with children
                          until our children were pre-teens. I went into full
                          time pastoring, and continuing the course of study that I needed.
