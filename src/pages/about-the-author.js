                                I felt the Call in the ministry at a young age of twenty five working with youth, teaching, and my new wife and I conducting childrenâ€™s church, and attending Bible School. We worked with children until our children were pre-teens. I went into full time pastoring, and continuing the course of study that I needed. Years had past by making friends, and working with all ages. Seeing hundreds, and thousands of people come to Christ in their lives. Making Disciples for Christ is my passion, seeing them grow Spiritually, and understand what it means to have the love of God. My wife and I live in Fairlawn Virginia where I am spending my retirement, and singing in a local church body, and sitting at my desk writing books.
