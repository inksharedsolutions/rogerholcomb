                                          of the hearts. Often, I observe, people do not allow themselves to experience the
                                          wholeness of life. So the life experience may have started with me as a small lad,
                                          working along with my grandfather, Amos Brady Westfall. As my grandfather worked several
                                          jobs, as a school teacher in one room school, a blacksmith, and also a farmer in 
                                          Jackson County, West Virginia.

                                          In the Episcopal Order of Worship, the priest sometimes
                                          introduces and mentions the Mosaic Law. The words given
                                          to Moses that the word [bold] is worth thinking about.
                                          We do well not to take the law lightly. It will take guts
                                          to look and not get bold enough in another way as having
                                          personal integrity to be accountable of yourself and be free
                                          of all guilt. This book will help you to be set free and true.
                                          There is a song that came out in the '60s and a movie, Born Free,
                                          the first line of the song caught my attention: "Born free, as free
                                          as the wind blows, as free as the grass grows. Born free to follow your heart." This was an inspiration to me. You can be set free and true as your heart.
